The MSAL library for JavaScript enables client-side JavaScript web applications, running in a web browser, to authenticate users using [Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) work and school accounts (AAD), Microsoft personal accounts (MSA) and social identity providers like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft accounts, etc. through [Azure AD B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview#identity-providers) service. It also enables your app to get tokens to access [Microsoft Cloud](https://cloud.microsoft.com) services such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).

## Installation
Via NPM:

    npm install msal

Via CDN:

    <!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->
    <script src="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/<version>/js/msal.js"></script>
    <script src="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/<version>/js/msal.min.js"></script>

Internet Explorer does not have native `Promise` support, and so you will need to include a polyfill for promises such as `bluebird`.

    <!-- IE support: add promises polyfill before msal.js  -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bluebird/3.3.4/bluebird.min.js" class="pre"></script>

See here for more details on [supported browsers and known compatability issues](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/FAQs#q4-what-browsers-is-msaljs-supported-on).

## Roadmap and What To Expect From This Library
Msal support on Javascript is a collection of libraries. msal-core or just simply msal, is the framework agnostic we library. Once our 1.X+ is stabilized, we are going to bring our msal-angular library to 1.x parity.  We are currently no planning on supporting msal-angularjs for 1.x, because the feedback we have heard is that community has moved on, however we will provide some code patterns of how you can use msal-core in an angularjs app. After our current libraries are up to standards, we will begin balancing new feature requests, with new platforms such as `react`, server side `node.js`, `electron`, etc...

Our goal is communicate extremely well with the community and to take their opinions into account. We would like to get to a monthly minor release schedule, with patches comming as often as needed.  The level of communication, planning, and granularity we want to get to will be a work in progress.

Please check our [roadmap](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki#roadmap) to see what we are workign on and what we are tracking next.

## Oauth and the Implict Flow
Msal implments the [Implicit Grant Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow), as defined by the Oauth 2.0 protocol and is [OpenID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc) compliant.

Our goal is that the library abstracts enough of this away that you can get plug and play authentication, but it is important to know for users that need AAD functionality outside of simple auth, and also important to understand from a security perspective.  There is no client secret, and one less hop between client and server, and so tokens are naturally less secure.  This is mitigated by the use of tokens with a short time to live. We encourage you to read about the flows, and the spec, so that you have a strong understanding of the use case.

## Cache Storage

We offer two methods of storage for Msal, `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.  Our recommendation is to use `sessionStorage` because it is more secure in storing tokens that are acquired by your users, but `localStorage` will give you Single Sign On accross tabs and user sessions.  We encourge you to explore the options and make the best decision for your application.

## Usage
The example below walks you through how to login a user and acquire a token to be used for Microsoft's Graph Api.

#### Prerequisite

Before using MSAL.js you will need to [register an application in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) to get a valid `clientId` for configuration, and to register the routes that your app will accept redirect traffic on.

#### 1. Instantiate the UserAgentApplication

`UserAgentApplication` can be configured with a variety of different options, detailed in our [Wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/MSAL.js-1.0.0-preview-api-release#configuration-options), but the only required parameter is `auth.clientId`.

After instantiating your instance, if you plan on using a redirect flow (`loginRedirect` and `acquireTokenRedirect`), you must register a callback handlers  using `handleRedirectCallbacks(successHandler, errorHandler)`. The callback function is called after the authentication request is completed either successfully or with a failure. This is not required for the popup flows since they return promises

```JavaScript
    var msalConfig = {
        auth: {
            clientId: 'your_client_id'
        }
    };

    var msalInstance = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(msalConfig);

    msalInstance.handleRedirectCallbacks(response => {
        // handle redirect response
    }), err => {
       // handle error
    });

```

#### 2. Login the user

Your app must login the user with either the `loginPopup` or the `loginRedirect` method to establish user context.

When the login methods are called and the authentication of the user is completed by the Azure AD service, an [id token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) is returned which is used to identify the user with some basic information.

When you login a user, you can request scopes up front if you know they will be needed, but it is not required, and login can be called with no params. It is best practice to only request scopes you need when you need them, a concept called dynamic consent. AAD will only allow you to get consent for 3 resources at a time, although you can request many scopes within a resource.

```JavaScript
   var loginRequest = {
       scopes: ["user.read", "mail.send"] // optional Array<string>
   };

    msalInstance.loginPopup(loginRequest)
        .then(response => {
            // handle response
        })
        .catch(err => {
            // handle error
        });

```

#### 3. Get an access token to call an API

In MSAL, you can get access tokens for the APIs your app needs to call using the `acquireTokenSilent` method which makes a silent request(without prompting the user with UI) to Azure AD to obtain an access token. The Azure AD service then returns an [access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) containing the user consented scopes to allow your app to securely call the API.

If the `acquireTokenSilent` call fails with an error of type `InteractionRequiredAuthError` (requiring the user to consent to something), you will need to initiate an interactive request. You can use `acquireTokenRedirect` or `acquireTokenPopup`.

`acquireTokenSilent` will look for a valid token in the cache, and if it is close to expiring or does not exist, will automatically refresh it for you.

```JavaScript
    // if the user is already logged in you can acquire a token
    if (msalInstance.getAccount()) {
        var tokenRequest = {
            scopes: ["user.read", "mail.send"]
        };
        msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(tokenRequest)
            .then(response => {
                // get access token from response
                // response.accessToken
            })
            .catch(err => {
                // could also check if err instance of InteractionRequiredAuthError if you can import the class.
                if (err.name === "InteractionRequiredAuthError") {
                    return msalnstance.acquireTokenPopup(tokenRequest)
                        .then(response => {
                            // get access token from response
                            // response.accessToken
                        })
                        .catch(err => {
                            // handle error
                        });
                }
            });
    } else {
        // user is not logged in, you will need to log them in to acquire a token
    }
```

#### 4. Use the token as a bearer in an HTTP request to call the Microsoft Graph or a Web API

```JavaScript
    var headers = new Headers();
    var bearer = "Bearer " + token;
    headers.append("Authorization", bearer);
    var options = {
         method: "GET",
         headers: headers
    };
    var graphEndpoint = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me";

    fetch(graphEndpoint, options)
        .then(resp => {
             //do something with response
        });
```

We enthusiastically welcome contributions and feedback. Please read the [contributing guide](contributing.md) before you begin.

## Security Library

This library controls how users sign-in and access services. We recommend you always take the latest version of our library in your app when possible. We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.x) ensures you get the latest security and feature enhanements but our API surface remains the same. You can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.

## Security Reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will contact you shortly upon receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when security incidents occur by visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948) and subscribing to Security Advisory Alerts.
